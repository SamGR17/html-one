    <h1>My favorite childhood memory</h1>
    <p>My favorite memory from my childhood might be one of the times I went to Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.</p> 
    <p>It has been a long time since I last gone there with my brother and sister, I wish I could go again someday.</p>
    <p>I remember going on a lot of rides that day, 
        the most memorable rides for me were the Undertow, Shockwave, and the Giant Dipper.</p>
    <p>We stayed there until it got dark, seeing all the rides at night was a vibe as I remember it.</p>
    <p>It is a shame that you only experience a memory once and don't even realize how precious it becomes until it passes.</p>
